# Portfolio-Desktop-Image-water-marking-app
This is a desktop image water marking application for Unix, Windows and Mac OSX. You need to have Tkinter installed and need to run the code. Here is how it works. First open an image using open  file. Then  open an image using Open water mark. Then move pointer where you want to stamp the water mark and press right mouse button. The result is dispayed and saved on the edited.png. 

The code is a mess but I wanted to share this early version since it's working.
